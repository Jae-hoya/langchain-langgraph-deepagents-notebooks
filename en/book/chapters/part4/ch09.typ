== 1. Comparison Overview

When choosing an AI agent framework, you need to consider several factors, including _model support_, _architecture_, _ecosystem_, and _license_.

In this notebook, you compare three major options:

- _LangChain Deep Agents_ — a model-agnostic agent harness
- _OpenCode_ — a coding agent environment centered on the terminal / desktop / IDE
- _Claude Agent SDK_ — Anthropic's SDK for Claude-based agents

== 3. Comparing Core Capabilities

=== Shared Capabilities
All three frameworks support the following categories:
- file operations (read, write, edit)
- shell command execution
- search features (`grep`, `glob`)
- planning support (task lists)
- Human-in-the-Loop (with different permission models)

#line(length: 100%, stroke: 0.5pt + luma(200))
== 4. Architecture Comparison

=== LangChain Deep Agents
- _Pluggable storage backends_ — state, filesystem, and store layers can be configured independently
- _Virtual filesystem_ — can switch between local, in-memory, or sandboxed backends
- _LangGraph-based runtime_ — supports complex workflows through graph execution
- _Middleware system_ — fine-grained control over agent behavior

=== OpenCode
- _Terminal-native_ — lightweight and fast to start
- _75+ model providers_ — includes local models through Ollama
- _LSP integration_ — optimized for code editing workflows

=== Claude Agent SDK
- _Claude-optimized_ — tailored for Claude model capabilities
- _Time travel_ — supports branching and state exploration
- _Concise API_ — useful for fast prototyping

#line(length: 100%, stroke: 0.5pt + luma(200))
== 7. Migration Considerations

Important questions when migrating between frameworks:

=== Shared Considerations
+ _Model compatibility_ — verify that the target framework supports the models you use
+ _Tool compatibility_ — check how your custom tool interfaces need to be adapted
+ _State management_ — plan how checkpoints and memory should be migrated
+ _Observability_ — decide how tracing and logging should be replaced or preserved

=== Advantages of Migrating to Deep Agents
- _LangChain tool reuse_ — existing LangChain tools can often be reused directly
- _LangGraph compatibility_ — integrates well with LangGraph-based workflows
- _Incremental migration_ — supports gradual adoption rather than all-at-once rewrites

=== Caveats
- Claude Agent SDK features that are Claude-specific may need alternative implementations
- Terminal UI logic from OpenCode may need to be separated from the core agent logic
