#chapter(3, "LangChain Conversations", subtitle: "Multi-Turn Memory")

Connect `InMemorySaver` so the agent can remember previous turns.


== Learning Objectives

- Store conversation state with `InMemorySaver`
- Distinguish conversation sessions with `thread_id`
- Run a multi-turn conversation where the agent remembers earlier context


== 3.1 Environment Setup


#code-block(`````python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv(override=True)

from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4.1")
print("✓ Model ready")

`````)

== 3.2 The Limit of an Agent Without Memory

A basic agent _does not store state_. Each call is treated like a new conversation.


== 3.3 Adding Memory with InMemorySaver

If you set a `checkpointer`, the agent stores the conversation history.
A `thread_id` distinguishes one conversation session from another.

_Short-term memory_ means keeping information from earlier interactions within a single conversation thread. This is essential for agents that handle complex tasks across several user turns.

Implementation pattern:
- Pass `InMemorySaver()` as the `checkpointer` parameter to enable memory.
- Use `thread_id` to distinguish different conversation sessions. If you reuse the same `thread_id`, the agent remembers the previous conversation.
- In production, you can switch to a database-backed checkpointer such as `PostgresSaver` for persistence.

If a conversation becomes very long, it may exceed the token budget. In that case, manage the history with strategies such as trimming, deletion, or summarization.


#code-block(`````python
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver

agent = create_agent(
    model=model,
    tools=[add],
    checkpointer=InMemorySaver(),
)

config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "session-1"}}
print("✓ Memory-enabled agent created")

`````)

== 3.4 Watching the Steps with Streaming

Use `agent.stream()` to observe each step of the agent in real time.

Agent streaming is useful when an agent runs for a while and you want to inspect intermediate steps as they happen. With `stream_mode="updates"`, you receive updates from each node individually, such as model calls and tool execution results. This lets you see what the agent is doing step by step.
