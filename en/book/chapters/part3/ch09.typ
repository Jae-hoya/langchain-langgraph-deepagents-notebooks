#chapter(9, "Subgraph", subtitle: "Graph within a graph")

== Learning Objectives

Modularize complex workflow with subgraphs.

== 9.1 Environment Setup

#code-block(`````python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv(override=True)
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4.1")
`````)

== 9.2 Subgraph concept

- _Subgraph_: Independent graph used as a node in another graph
- _Advantages_: Modularization, reuse, independent development by team
- Each subgraph has its own state(State)
- state between parent \<-\> subgraph is mapped to _shared key_

== 9.3 Creating a subgraph

== 9.4 Adding a subgraph to the parent graph

== 9.4.1 Pattern 1: Subgraph call through wrapper node (if `state_schema` is different)

In the above example (9.4), the parent graph and subgraph shared _the same keys_ (`text`, `word_count`, `char_count`), so the compiled subgraph could be passed directly to `add_node()`.

However, in practice, the **`state_schema`_ of the parent graph and subgraph are often completely different_. In this case, using a _wrapper function_:

+ _Extract_ the required fields from the parent state and convert them to subgraph input.
+ _Run_ the subgraph
+ _Map_ the subgraph output to the parent state format.

Use the pattern. This is how the official documentation calls it _Pattern 1: Call Subgraph Inside a Node_.

== 9.5 LLM-based subgraph

Organize the full text agent into subgraphs.

== 9.6 Subgraph streaming

Steps inside a subgraph are also streaming possible.
